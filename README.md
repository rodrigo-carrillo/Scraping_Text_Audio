**Scraping Exercise**

* **Scrape_Text.ipynb:**
This notebook scrapes text from multiple pages on a website. The output is a dataframe containing metadata (e.g., publication date and category), the title of the news story, and the news text.

* **Downloads_Audios.ipynb:**
This notebook downloads audio files associated with the news story. Occasionally, individuals submit news stories about local events, and they do so via audio files.

* **Gen_Social_Media_Post.ipynb:**
This notebook creates a class that enables the use of three large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, Gemma, and Gemini from Huggingface) to analyze news and generate brief (100 words) social media posts based on that news.
